# Machine learning proyects

Repository of machine learning proyects. It contains analysis, visualization and code examples to confront different types of machine learning problems, such as regressions, classifiers, unsupervised learning and neural networks among others. 

All the code is write on Python, I recommend you to use Jupyter Notebook since is the easiest way to start coding and learning :)
